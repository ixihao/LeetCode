### Description
Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
### 26.1 Basic method
**Idea**: Compare the item with the next item in the list. If they are the same, pop the item until the item is not equal to the next item. There is something little tricky that when pop an item from the list, the length of the list will change and also index of element in the list. So, it is difficult to understand when you process a list from left to right. You can try to process the list from right to left. The basic idea will change the length of origin list, but doesn't use extra O(1) memory.

**Time Complexity**: O(n^2)

``` python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Basic Method
        # Process list from left to right
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            while i<len(nums)-1 and nums[i] == nums[i+1]:
                nums.pop(i)
        return len(nums)
```

``` python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Basic Method
        # Process list from right to left
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            while i <= len(nums)-2 and nums[-1-i] == nums[-2-i]:
                nums.pop(-1-i)
        return len(nums)
```

### 26.2 Fastest method
**Idea**: Use the extra memory to store the previous value that you want to compare, and the variable <code>index + 1</code> is the length of unique value. If you find an element that diffirent with the previous value, then put it after the previous value, assign the value to previous and update index. If you find an element that is the same with previous, then move forward to check next one.

**Time Complexity**: O(n)

``` python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Fastest Method
        if len(nums) < 2:
            return len(nums)
        
        previous = nums[0]
        index = 0
        for i in range(1, len(nums), 1):
            if nums[i] != previous:
                index += 1
                nums[index] = nums[i]  
                previous = nums[i]
 
        return index + 1
```

### 26.3 Shortest method
As first example in 26.1

### 26.4 Summary
1. When you modify a list (insert or remove items) during iteration, the result maybe incorrect. Since the index of items has already updated after you modify (insert or remove) the list, you may skip some items you want to process. There are two ways I prefer to solve this kind of problem: 
    1. iterate the list in reverse; 
    2. Use while loop and don't increment index when remove an item from list in this problem (like 26.1).  

For example:
``` python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Iterate list in reverse
        for i, v in reversed(list(enumerate(nums))):
            if i>0 and v == nums[i-1]:
                nums.pop(i)
        return len(nums)
```

2. List methods comparison:  

| Operation | Example | Complexity Class | In-place or Not | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Index | l[i] | O(1) | N/A | |
| Store | l[i]=0 | O(1) | N/A | |
| Length | len(l) | O(1) | N/A | |
| Append | l.append(5) | O(1) | In-place | |
| Pop | l.pop() | O(1) | In-place | |
| Clear | l.clear() | O(1) | In-place | |
| Slice | l[a:b] | O(b-a) | Not | |
| Pop | l.pop(k) | O(k) | In-place | |
| Extend | l.extend(...) | O(len(...)) | In-place | Only depends on len of entension |
| Construction | list(...) | O(len(...)) | N/A | Depends on length of ... iterable |
| Check ==, != | l1 == l2 | O(N) | N/A | |
| Insert | l[a:b] = ... / l.insert(i,x)| O(N) | In-place | |
| Delete | del l[i] | O(N) | In-place | Depends on i; O(N) in worst case |
| Containment | x in/not in l | O(N) | N/A | linearly searches list |
| Copy| l.copy() | O(N) | N/A | |
| Remove | l.remove(...) | O(N) | In-place | |
| Count | l.count(x) | O(N) | N/A | |
| Index | l.index(x[, start[, end]]) | O(N) | N/A | |
| Extreme value | min(l)/max(l) | O(N) | N/A | Linearly searches list for value |
| Reverse | l.reverse() | O(N) | In-place | |
| Iteration | for i in l: | O(N) | N/A | Worst: no return/break in loop |
| Sort | l.sort() | O(NlogN) | In-place | |
| Multiply | k*l | O(k N) | Not | |

3. The costs of list.remove(x) and list.pop([i]) is very different.
