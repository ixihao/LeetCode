### 1.1 Basic method
**Idea**:  Loop the list nums, and try to find if sum of the item and one of next items equal to the target. If the sum is equal to the target, return index of these two items.  

**Time Complexity**: ```O(n^2)```

``` python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        # Basic Method
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):
                if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                    return[i,j]
```

### 1.2 Fastest method
**Idea**: Create a dictionary stores the ```value:index``` pair incrementally, if the difference between target and an item is in the dictionary, then return index, or update the dictionary. This method is just loop nums once. And can skip the situation that one item equal to the difference between target and itself, since the first time come across the item, the difference(item itself) isn't in the dictionary.  

**Time Complexity**: ```O(n)```

``` python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        # Fastest Method
        dic = {}
        for i, v in enumerate(nums):
            if target-v in dic:
                return [dic[target-v], i]
            # Update the dictionary
            dic[v] = i
```

### 1.3 Shortest method (Code Golf)
**Idea**: Try to find the difference in the remaining list, and return the index pair. This method can skip the situation that the difference is the same as the item.  

**Time Complexity**: ```O(n^2)```

``` python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        # Shortest Method
        for i,v in enumerate(nums):
            try: return [i, nums.index(target-v,i+1,)]
            except: pass
```

``` python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        # Shortest Method
        for i,v in enumerate(nums):
            try: return [i, nums.index(target-v,i+1,)]
            except: pass
```

### 1.4 Summary
1. Try to avoid use list.index(), since time complexity of ```list.index(i)``` is O(n) ([reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5913671/complexity-of-list-indexx-in-python)). Hashtable(dictionary) is more efficient.
2. Ways to remove item from a list:
``` python

```
    1.pop()
    2.das)()
