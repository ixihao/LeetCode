### 1.1 Basic method
**Idea**:  Loop the list nums, and try to find if sum of the item and one of next items equal to the target. If the sum is equal to the target, return it.  
**Time Complexity**: O(n^2)

``` python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        # Basic Method
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):
                if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                    return[i,j]
```

### 1.2 Fastest method
**Idea**: Create a dictionary(index) store the value:index pair, if the difference in the dictionary, just return; else update the dictionary. This method is just loop nums once. And can skip the situation that the item and the difference is the same, since the first time come across the item, the difference(item itself) isn't in the dictionary.  
**Time Complexity**: O(n)

``` python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        # Fastest Method
        dic = {}
        for i, v in enumerate(nums):
            if target-v in dic:
                return [dic[target-v], i]
            # Update the dictionary
            dic[v] = i
```

### 1.3 Shortest method
**Idea**: Try to find the difference in the remaining list, and return the index pair. This method can skip the situation that the difference is the same as the item.  
**Time Complexity**: O(n^2)
``` python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        # Shortest Method
        for i,v in enumerate(nums):        
            try: return [i, nums[i+1:].index(target-v)+i+1]
            except: pass
```

### 1.4 Summary
1. Try to use dictionary to store some information you may use later.
2. Time Complexity of ```list.index(i)``` is O(n) ([reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5913671/complexity-of-list-indexx-in-python))
